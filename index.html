									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>
										Since I was a child and my father brought the first computer at home, I have been passionate about technology. 
										I still remember how I had to use 2 floppy disk to play with my favourite video game and how excited I was the day my father brought the first digital Encyclopaedia in CD ( unfortunately not in my native language so I still had to go to the Library to do my homework).
										<br>
										<br>
										During my last year at school, I attended a seminar about networks, antennas, coding, etc and again, I felt in love with this world. Because of that, I decided to become a <strong>master’s degree in telecommunication engineering</strong>.

								<h2>History experience</h2>
								<p>
									During my last year at university, I worked as an apprentice in a Service Provider and they recommended me to one of their partners. That is how I started to work as a <strong>Unified Communications Engineer</strong>.
									<br>
									<br>
									I started my career working for the <em>Production Department</em>, as a <strong>video support engineer</strong>; I supported the video issues of our customers remotely and resolve them on-site when required. This first experience enabled me to  <strong>develop my technical skills</strong> and shaped <strong>my communication and interpersonal</strong> skills dealing with customers at sometimes under pressure. 
									Few months later, my role became a “mixed role”, being a VC support engineer and an VC installation engineer role at the same time.  
									<br>
									<br>
									Then, the world of the video and voice networks converged, and I needed an upskill for the new reality. I became a <strong>Unified Communication engineer</strong>. During this period, there was an important demand from our customers to update their platforms. It was critical to meet deadlines and having a good knowledge of both areas. I mainly worked in the installation team, helping the support team when they needed it. 
									<br>
									<br>
									That last role taught me a lot about <strong>project management</strong>, dealing with the unexpected, planning, testing, etc. But still I had not a global and holistic view of the projects. I was working on them, but not managing them. Because of that, I asked my line manager to move to a more managerial role seeking for new challenges and fill the aforementioned gap. I then became a <strong>Unified Communications Project Manager</strong>. There I was, in charge of the planning phase, management and monitoring of the whole life cycle of Unified Communications Projects, from the conception to the installation and maintenance.
									<br>
									<br>
									Finally, following a career progression scheme in the company, I had the opportunity to work a few months as a <strong>pre-sales engineer</strong> supporting the sales department.

								<h2>Why I wish to return to tech</h2>
								<p>
									I have always been passionate about technology. I have always enjoyed reading about new developments, robots, IA or fast speed networks. I am also an avid user of the 
									technology in my daily life, I do the shopping online,  keep contact with my family and friends remotely, use the calendar to remind me everything… all those things 
									help me in my day to day and I think we are responsible for the developments of the future that could (and should) help much more people in many ways; maybe things 
									that we can’t imagine yet. I do want to contribute to make it real. In these uncertain times, I want to help society through what I like, Technology.  
									So I want to come back, reskilling, learning, familiarising myself with new areas, new philosophies and new ways to do things and follow the path to reach the objectives 
									that I have set for my life and my career.
